To run the experiment code, please install the mechanism-learn package using the distribution file 'mechanism_learn-2.3.1-py3-none-any.whl' in the './code/dist' folder.

In Python, use: import mechanism_learn.pipeline to import the mechanism learning algorithms. Using examples are demonstrated in './code/main expr' folder

Please note that due to the limit of file size, we cannot attach all experiment data, such as ICH CT scans and the Background-MNIST data. The original ICH data is available in the study Hssayeni, M. (2020). Computed Tomography Images for Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection and Segmentation (version 1.3.1). PhysioNet. RRID:SCR_007345. However, we include data of the embedded mediator and the clean haemorrhage category. Meanwhile, we also attach the mediator autoencoder's model h5 files in .\test_data\ICH_data\autoencoder\

For the Background-MNIST data, it is modified from the original MNIST dataset. This semi-synthetic Background MNIST dataset can be generated by using the Python code file: .\test_data\semi_synthetic_data\semi-synthetic_data_gen.py.

For synthetic data, they are stored in CSV files in the folder: .\test_data\synthetic_data. And the original data generation code can be found, named: synthetic_data_gen.py.
